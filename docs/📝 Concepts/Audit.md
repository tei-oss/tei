#todo : write about external audit

All relevant entities must contain both inline audit data and logged audit data.

## Inline audit data
Inline audit data contains following:
- `created_at` â€” [[Timestamp|timestamp]] of creation.
%% I'm not quite sold on initial null value, does it really matter whether or not entity has been updated after creation, to me it seems that we can treat creation as update and set it to creation time initially %%
- `updated_at` â€” [[Timestamp|timestamp]] of the last modification. Initially should be null .
- `created_by` â€” [[ðŸ—ƒ Entities/User#^id|Id]] of the user who created the entity .
- `updated_by` â€” [[ðŸ—ƒ Entities/User#^id|Id]] of the last user who modified the entity.
- `version` â€” integer version of given entity. May be used to perform [[CAS Updates|CAS updates]]. ^version

Invariants:
- [[Audit#^version|Version]] should always increase.
