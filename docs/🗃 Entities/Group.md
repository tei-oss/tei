A group represents a root level of entry organization. 

A group consists of:
- `id` â€” a [[Id|unique identifier]] of the group.
- `title` â€” an arbitrary textual name, associated with the group.
- `members` â€” a list of [[Group#Member|members]] of the group. *Maybe it shouldn't be accessible directly? How can we control members count?* ^members
- `tags` â€” a list of [[Tag|tags]] associated with the group.
- [[Audit]] information.

Invariants:

- `added_at` â€” [[Timestamp]] when member was added.
